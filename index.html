          <img src="assets/CSS/image/Mypic.png" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
          <p> I am currently taking a coding boot camp class at UC Berkeley extension.
            I am a fast learner, hardworking, friendly, and team-oriented person.
          </p>
          <p> I have excellent customer service skills. I worked as an uber driver, a shift supervisor at Safeway, and a
            draftsman in Ethiopia.
            My Job experiences helped me develop excellent leadership, team building, and communication skills.
          </p>
          <p> I enjoy nature photography and hikes. I have traveled around the bay to capture pictures.
            I enjoy watching the sunset at the beach and watching the sunrise from the mountain top.
            I have not watched many sunrises because I am just at the beginning of my hiking journey.
            I hope to visit more places.
          </p>
          <p>I am passionate about social justice and social inequalities. I believe in having conversations and
            lifting everyone regardless of their racial, social, economic, and sexual background.
          </p>
